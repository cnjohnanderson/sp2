# Typeahead Search

## Description

<<<<<<< HEAD
Typeahead Search lets the user searching with suggestions, through REST, and finally to select and send a record through the event "pe-typeahead-selection".
=======
The Typeahead Search widget provides suggestions for users as they type in the search field. Main features are:
<br/>
* Providing suggestions through the autocomplete search library [Twitter Typeahead v1.2.0](https://github.com/corejavascript/typeahead.js)
* Obtaining data through REST. It can be connected also to a Table API defined in a different ServiceNow instance if the relative option _REST Instance_ is used, and a [CORS rule](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/london-application-development/page/integrate/inbound-rest/concept/c_CORSSupport.html) defined in the target instance.
* Broadcasting on record selection (event name: "pe-typeahead-selection"). Sample code for receiving the selected record (json object) in any widgets used in the Portal application:

```javascript

$rootScope.$on('pe-typeahead-selection', function(event, obj){

  /* code */

});

```
